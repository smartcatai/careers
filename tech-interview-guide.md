# Tech Interview Guide

### Introduction

Our goal for technical interviews is to assess a candidate's technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and how well they align with Smartcat's [Culture Code](https://www.smartcat.com/culture-code/). Below, you'll find detailed information about each stage of our interview process, including what to expect and how to prepare.

The entire hiring process is spread across 4 - 5 hours. There will be 3 main interviews and a *Reference Check*. Feedback after each interview will be provided within 2 to 3 business days.

The interviews will take place on Google Meet. You will need a computer and a stable internet connection to participate.

### Reference check

Once you have completed the interview stages, the last two stages are the *Reference Check* stage followed by the offer confirmation stage. Reference check stage is mandatory for all hires regardless of level, department or location. We check references on everyone from entry-level to C-Suite across all teams and locations.

We do reference checks on all candidates to get a more well-rounded perspective on your strengths. The hiring manager will be the one contacting your references. It's been our experience that when our hiring managers connect with the candidate's previous manager(s) or co-workers, our managers are able to provide better coaching to the candidate immediately.
